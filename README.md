# UTSC-Notes

This is a repository of my course notes, created using LaTeX.

Note that the documents have functional cross-referencing with hyperlinks citing theorems and facts (GitHub's default
PDF viewer may not support this; you might have to download the files and use a different PDF viewer for clickable
hyperlinks).

There is also a fact list after the table of contents in each document (also with working hyperlinks).

## LaTeX Packages Used

Here are the packages used:

- `amsmath`, `amssymb`, `commath`, and `mathtools` &mdash; basic math symbols
- `derivative` &mdash; derivative and differential symbols
- `ntheorem` &mdash; enhanced theorem-like environments
- `cleveref` &mdash; enhanced cross-referencing (with definitions, theorems, etc.)
- `tcolorbox` &mdash; framed boxes for theorem-like environments
- `fancyhdr` &mdash; page headers
- `hyperref` &mdash; hyperlinks in the table of contents and theorem/definition citations
- `graphicx` &mdash; images

Various other packages such as `titlesec`, `parskip`, and `enumitem` were also used to tweak minor formatting options.
